# AdventOfCode

It is that time of year, it is getting cold outside, the first christmas trees are starting glitter, and many programmers around the world crack their knuckles solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
This is the repository for my solutions. It is mostly solved in C++ / Julia / Python.
I am usually not that sporty, but there is nothing like golfing in the cold.

In the solution file of a day, you can find the solutions in one or more languages, my input file and my output file.

## ToDo
 Migrate 2019 and 2018
