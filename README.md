# AdventOfCode

It is that time of year, it is getting cold outside, the first christmas trees are starting glitter, and many programmers around the world crack their knuckles solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
This is the repository for my solutions. It is mostly solved in C++ / Julia / Python.
I am usually not that sporty, but there is nothing like golfing in the cold.

In the solution file of a day, you can find the solutions in one or more languages, my input file and my output file.

## ToDo
 Migrate 2019 and 2018<!SOLUTIONS>
<!-- Do not remove this lines, and write nothing after the <!SOLUTIONS> tag -->
<!--       They are used as marker for the generate_readme() function       -->
